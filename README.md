Data Science Projects from DataQuest

This repo showcases the projects I'm completing for the Data Analyst/Data Scientist program in the on line bootcamp Dataquest. These projects were done in Jupyter notebooks.  The "Guided Projects" are analyses from .csv files on the Web. The "SQL Guided Projects" utilized SQLite to query databases or create a new database.
